# 100 days of codeUp

## Day 1/100

Today I started a course about Go, I took some time to get familiar with the structure of the language, basic syntax, operators and variables.

## Day 2/100

Today I learned about numeric systems, constants and the runtime package in Go, I also did the local environment setup for developing in VS code and started checking possible projects to develop in order to practice Go.
